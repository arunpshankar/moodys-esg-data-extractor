## Steps to Follow

### 1. Ingredient Gathering
- Capture all relevant categories of data.
- Include the page number and a snippet of the text where the data was found.

### 2. Raw Value Extraction
- Extract raw values for all categories.
- Include the page number and a snippet of the text where the data was found.
- If multiple data points have the same label but different contexts (Global, Partial), include the context label and reasoning.
- Provide a relevant information summary field if applicable.

### 3. Year Extraction
- Determine the reporting year for each data point.

### 4. Final Answer
- Compile a comprehensive report for each identified year and metric.
- Ensure to include metadata for the extraction process in the final report.

### 5. Modular Data Capture
- Capture each metric individually and ensure it is clearly distinct from other metrics.

### 6. Scope Categories
- **Global**: Data that covers the entire operations of the company worldwide.
- **Regional**: Data that covers specific geographical regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).
- **Country-Specific**: Data that covers operations within a specific country.

### 7. Partial / Full Flag
**Rule**:
- **Default to Full Flag**: By default, assign the **Full** flag to all data points unless there is clear evidence that the data is limited in scope.
- **Assign Partial Flag**: Assign the **Partial** flag if any of the following conditions are met:
  - The data is limited to specific departments or subsets of the company's operations.

### 8. Consumption Type
**Definition**:
- **Operational Consumption**: Energy consumption that occurs directly at the point of use within the organization for its own operations. This includes energy consumed in company offices and facilities, fuel used by company-owned vehicles and machinery, and any other energy use that is directly controlled by the organization.
- **Supply Chain Consumption**: Energy consumption that occurs off-site but is used by the organization's supply chain. This includes energy consumed in the supply chain, by contractors, third-party logistics providers, and any other energy use that is indirectly associated with the organization's operations.

**Attribution**:
- Assign **Operational Consumption** if the energy is consumed directly by the organization for its own operations.
- Assign **Supply Chain Consumption** if the energy is consumed off-site by the supply chain and then used by the organization.

## What to Capture
- Energy consumption metrics for the organization's own operations and supply chain.
- Raw values for any source of energy consumed with their respective units.
- Data for the most recent year only.

## What to Avoid
- Energy generation metrics.
- Energy capacity metrics.
- Emissions metrics (e.g., data measured in CO2e).

High-Level Instructions:
- The analysis should yield raw values for any source of energy consumed with their respective units.
- Avoid performing any calculations; capture only the pure raw values as available.
- Capture data for the most recent year only.
- **Thousand Separators**: When encountering big numbers, remove any thousand separators (such as commas, periods, or spaces) and retain the decimal separator as it is.
- **Examples**:
  - "1,000,000.78" becomes "1000000.78"
  - "1.000.000,78" becomes "1000000,78"
  - "1 000 000.78" becomes "1000000.78"
  - "8,505,686" becomes "8505686"
  - "8.505.686" becomes "8505686"
